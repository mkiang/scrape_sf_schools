# San Francisco Public Elementary Schools Data

There are 74 public elementary schools in San Francisco Unified School District and zero public data sets containing basic information about these schools. I've scraped the official website and created a `csv` file with public information for each school. This includes school type, estimated enrollment, principal, hours, middle school they feed into, etc. 

The csv file can be viewed in [`./data/sf_elementary_schools.csv`](https://github.com/mkiang/scrape_sf_schools/blob/master/data/sf_elementary_schools.csv).

The data were collected from the [Official SFUSD website](https://www.sfusd.edu/schools-search).
