# San Francisco Public Elementary Schools Data

There are 74 public elementary schools in San Francisco Unified School
District and zero public data sets containing basic information about
these schools. Iâ€™ve scraped the official website and created a `csv`
file with public information for each school. This includes school type,
estimated enrollment, principal, hours, middle school they feed into,
etc.

The csv file can be viewed in
[`./data/sf_elementary_schools.csv`](https://github.com/mkiang/scrape_sf_schools/blob/master/data/sf_elementary_schools.csv).

The data were collected from the [Official SFUSD
website](https://www.sfusd.edu/schools-search).
